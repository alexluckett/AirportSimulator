USAGE:
AirportSimulator [-?] [-P ppp] [-S sss] [-Priority | -FIFO] [-D] [-AUTO aaa]

-?        	Shows this help output instead.
-P        	Set probability. ppp Specifies probability of arrival for Commercial Aircraft ("p").
-S        	Random seed. To allow for repeatable testing. sss must comply with a java long data type with a 
          	value from -2^63 to 2^63-1.
-D        	Display debug output.
-Priority	Set the arrivals to use the priority system
-FIFO 		(optional) Set the arrivals to use the first-in-first-out system
-Auto       Runs the simulation in automatic mode. Will find a given value of P.
			aaa is the number of times to run the simulation for, taking an average of all good results.
